## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create a website that provides the
user to upload his/her documents on a web server.



## Functional Requrment
>
> - if the user wants to upload a document, the
system creates a new directory on the server with name
[DocumentName_DocumentId] and then upload its file on
the same directory.
>  - User can update document information by
selecting what document he/she want to update from the
data table.
>  - User can View all documents information from
the data table.
> - User can delete document full record including
its files from the server, the server first deletes the
document’s directory including its files from the server then
deletes the full records from the database.

## Non- Functional Requirements
> ### Availability :
> The site must be contactable 24 hours .
> ###  Security :
>  Documents are secured on the server and can’t be
manipulated.
> ### Usability :
> The site should be suitable for all ages.
> It should be easy to use so that the user can understand it.
